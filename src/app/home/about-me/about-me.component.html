         I'm a full time Front-end Developer who enjoys creating organized solutions.
          A few of my hobbies include soccer (watching and playing), boxing, snow boarding, live music,
          gaming, and traveling.
          I currently work for Dillard’s where I develop intranet Front-end applications.
          In addition, I like to work on side projects in my spare time. </h2>
